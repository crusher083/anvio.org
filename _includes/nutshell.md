Anvi'o is a comprehensive platform that brings together many aspects of today's cutting-edge computational strategies of data-enabled microbiology, including **genomics**, **metagenomics**, **metatranscriptomics**, **pangenomics**, **metapangenomics**, **phylogenomics**, and **microbial population genetics** in an *integrated* and *easy-to-use* fashion through extensive **interactive visualization** capabilities.

{:.notice}
The latest stable version of anvi'o is `v{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}`, and you can see the release notes [here](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/releases/v{% include _project-anvio-version-number-major.html %}).

The platform stands on **more than 200,000 lines of Python and JavaScript code** that follow modern software development paradigms thanks to the voluntary contributions of **more than [30 developers](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt)** from the academia and industry to [empower microbiologists](/testimonials/) for their [complex needs](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/releases) through an architecture that [enables reproducible science](http://merenlab.org/2016/11/21/bacteroides-genome-variants/) and simple interfaces for data access.

As a principle, anvi'o does not track its users by any means, but based on [self-reported data on Twitter](https://twitter.com/merenbey/status/1218364014641786882), there is at least one anvi'o user in the following countries:
